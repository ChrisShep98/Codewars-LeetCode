# Implement a function that computes the difference between two lists. 
# The function should remove all occurrences of elements from the first list (a) that are present in the second list (b). 
# The order of elements in the first list should be preserved in the result.

# Examples:
# If a = [1, 2] and b = [1], the result should be [2].
# If a = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] and b = [2], the result should be [1, 3].


# def array_diff(a, b)
#   a - b
# end

def array_diff(a, b)
  a.difference(b)
end


puts "#{array_diff([1, 2], [1])} -> [2]"
puts "#{array_diff([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2])} -> [1, 3]"
